    "## Chapter 1 - Machine Learning Landscape\n",
    "- <b>Machine Learning</b> - is the science and art of programming computers so they can learn from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Machine Learning Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Supervised Learning\n",
    "    - The training data includes the desired solutions. Can be either classification(discrete) or regression(numerical) type of problem.\n",
    "    - Example of applications include, classifying whether an email is spam or not. Or determining the cost of a car based on its features (# of seats, MPG, HP, tourque).\n",
    "    ![supervised_classification](images/chapter_1/supervised_classification.png)\n",
    "    ![supervised_regression](images/chapter_1/supervised_regression.png)\n",
    "    - The predictors or features are the columns which can help in determining what the label should be.\n",
    "    - Important supervised Algorithims\n",
    "        - K-Nearest Neighbours\n",
    "        - Linear Regression\n",
    "        - Logistic Regression\n",
    "        - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "        - Decision Tress\n",
    "        - Random Forests\n",
    "        - Neural Networks\n",
    "- #### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "    - The training data does not include the \"answers\" - it is not labelled. The system tries to learn without a teacher.\n",
    "    - Example of application include, clustering similar users that visit a blog. In this case we don't know which users are similar, but the clustering algorithim will group together users which have similar features (ex. Male, like comics, time of visit to blogsite.)\n",
    "    - Important unsupervised Algorithms\n",
    "        - Clustering\n",
    "            - K-means\n",
    "            - DBSCAN\n",
    "            - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)\n",
    "        - Anomaly detection and novelty detection\n",
    "            - One class SVM\n",
    "            - Isolation Forest\n",
    "        - Visualization and Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "            - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "            - Kernel PCA\n",
    "            - Local-linear Embedding (LLE)\n",
    "            - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\n",
    "        - Association rule Learning\n",
    "            - Apriori\n",
    "            - Eclat\n",
    "            \n",
    "- #### Semisupervised Learning\n",
    "    - When the data is partially labelled, semisupervised algorithims are utilized.\n",
    "    - Example of applications include a photo tagging service, which may need help indentifying the names of the individual in the begining but then begin to label by themselves.\n",
    "- #### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "    - The learning system is called the Agent.\n",
    "    - The agent can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get rewards or penalties in response.\n",
    "    - Using the rewards and penalties, it can come up with a best strategy called a policy. Essentially the policy will look to maximize the rewards.\n",
    "    ![reinforcement_learning](images/chapter_1/reinforcement_learning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch and Online Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Batch Learning\n",
    "    - The system is incapable of learning incrementally. It must be trained using all availaible data.\n",
    "    - Takes a long time depending on the size of the data.\n",
    "    - Generally done offline. \n",
    "    - System is trained, launched into production. If new data comes in, then the system needs to be taken offline, re-trained using all data again (including the new data) and then relaunced into production.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Online Learning\n",
    "    - The system is trained incrementally by being exposed to data in smaller chunks. The chunks can be individual or in small chunks called mini-batches. \n",
    "    - Becuase the training data is smaller when compared to the entire dataset, the training set is a lot faster.\n",
    "    - Requires less computer resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning\n",
    "- #### Instance-based learning\n",
    "    - The model compares the new value to a existing value it has already seen before in the training set.\n",
    "    - The new value will be classified the same as the closest value it has already seen.\n",
    "    - This can also work for regression problems, by taking the average of the closest values from the training dataset.\n",
    "    - Examples include K nearest neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Model-based learning\n",
    "    - A model is created where the parameters of the new value can be entered into the system and a resulting answer will generate.\n",
    "    - Example include using linear regression to predict house prices. The linear regression model in this case will generate an equation in the form $y =mx+b$. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting vs Underfitting\n",
    "- #### Overfitting\n",
    "    - The model performs very well on the training data, but fails to generalize to the test data.\n",
    "    - Can use regularization techniques to punish overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Underfitting\n",
    "    - Model is too simple and fails to learn the underlying structure of the data.\n",
    "    - Example, if we are trying to fit a linear regression mode to a model which should actually be better represented by a polynomial."
